# RS-DAT

Remote Sensing Deployable Analysis environmenT (RS-DAT) is an environment for deploying and running remote sensing analysis workflows on high-performance/high-throughput computing (HPC/HTC) systems and associated storage resources, while making use of the tools and interfaces (Jupyter Notebooks, Python, etc.). It seamlessly integrates and extends the Python and PyData ecosystem, including Dask and Xarray, and provides tools for data storage and retrieval on mass storage systems (e.g., dCache at SURF).

## How can I deploy RS-DAT for my use case?
RS-DAT consists of multiple components to allow its use on different computing infrastructures, such as [Snellius](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/snellius-the-national-supercomputer), [Spider](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/high-performance-data-processing) and [Research Cloud](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/surf-research-cloud) offered by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en/about), or university computation infrastructures such as [DelftBlue](https://www.tudelft.nl/dhpc/system). Please refer to the [deploy documentation](https://rs-dat.github.io/RS-DAT/deploying/jupyter_dask_on_slurm/) on how to deploy RS-DAT on various computing infrastructures.

## Use cases
RS-DAT has been applied to multiple Earth Observation (EO) use cases. Feel free to explore the [use cases](https://rs-dat.github.io/RS-DAT/examples/) and see if there are relevant examples for your case.
